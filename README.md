# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials Grid Section Solution
## 🚀 Overview

This is my solution to the [Testimonials Grid Section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7) on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a responsive testimonials section using HTML and CSS, matching the provided design as closely as possible.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Frontend Mentor starter files  

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adapts based on the screen size to ensure a great user experience on both mobile and desktop devices. Grid and Flexbox were combined to create a clean and balanced layout.
